## The Case for Commitment

In January 2019, I decided to focus on web development and become a frontend engineer. I was mostly inspired by one of my friends, [cirlorm](https://www.cirlorm.dev). This guy was basically a genius. I told myself if he can create these cool things, I can too! I was ðŸ’¯ motivated.

Without watching any roadmaps or asking anyone for help on how to go about this, I started learning HTML and CSS. Note that I already had a little background in programming. I had been learning [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and [Unity 3D](https://unity.com) at the time, so I did have some basic concepts down. I also had some basic knowledge of the [Python](https://www.python.org) language, but I wasn't consistent with learning them. I was sorta up and down with it.

While learning HTML and CSS, I kept hearing about other technologies that intrigued me. I was so excited to see what people were building with these technologies that I couldn't wait to get my hands on them. However, I had no firm knowledge of some basics required to use those technologies. I decided to learn JavaScript without fully grasping the concepts of HTML and CSS. You can guess it was pretty rough for me. I struggled with JS a lot, and sometimes I didn't even know what I was doing (who does, though?). I was frustrated because when I learned a concept and understood it, I didn't apply those concepts to see if I could truly remember them. I just went ahead and said bluntly, _"I am done with JavaScript."_

I told myself, _"I am done with JS" or "I know JS,"_ but in actual fact, I couldn't even write a common function. It was so stressful that I couldn't understand certain things, so I basically gave up. In 2022, I then decided to learn Java. This was a "must" for me to learn because it was required for Computer Science students, and I was a CS student .I grew fond of it because of its strong typing system and the structured, rule-based nature of the language.. So I decided to focus on Java. I tried learning the basics, but again I was intrigued by the amazing desktop apps people were creating and how cool Spring Boot was!

I decided to watch some YouTube videos to gain some knowledge. I followed some tutorials and felt pretty confident while learning them. The problem was I was learning without _practicing_. I wasn't building any _mini-projects_ to assimilate what I'd learned. When I finally sat down to build something on my own, I was completely **LOST** and mostly **CONFUSED**. This was all due to me not staying _consistent_. I was determined but not consistent.

This reduced my confidence, and I was giving up. February 2022 was the worst. I had the biggest **_breakdown_**. I completely gave up on everything, literally everything. I felt really _useless_. I told myself that was it for me, I was done for. It was actually **_hard_**.

### How I Bounced Back

How did I bounce back? I saw that I was behind. It seemed everyone was moving forward, and I was regressing. Again, I saw a project by [cirlorm](https://www.cirlorm.dev), and I was sort of motivated. I told myself this time I'm going to actually "**_DO IT_**". So I restarted watching tutorials on HTML and CSS again. This time, I told myself I would actually stick to it and learn it. Fast forward after 2-4 months, I actually understood what I was doing. I started building out clones of sites, and it was satisfying and amazing!

Then, I started learning JavaScript. Though it was a little bit annoying and kinda weird, it was cool too! I learned so many things from watching tutorials to reading docs. Then I finally had the confidence to learn React and other technologies. It was an easy transition for me, and I'm glad to have gone through all that to get to where I am. I keep learning every single day, and it's so amazing!

The point is _learning doesn't stop_. You keep learning and progressing. Even the pros still learn every day. So be consistent and determined. Learn one thing at a time, practice, practice, and practice until you're comfortable. There are roadmaps to becoming a frontend and backend developer. Follow them. Get comfortable with one before moving to another.

### How to Focus on One Programming Language

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with this language. Setting clear, achievable goals will help keep you motivated and on track.

2. **Stick to a Schedule**: Consistency is key. Dedicate a specific amount of time each day or week to learning and practicing the language.

3. **Master the Basics**: Ensure you have a solid understanding of the basics before moving on to more advanced topics.

4. **Build Projects**: Apply what you learn by building projects. Start small and gradually take on more complex projects.

5. **Seek Feedback**: Don't be afraid to ask for help or feedback from more experienced developers. This can provide valuable insights and help you improve.

6. **Use Online Resources**: There are countless tutorials, documentation, and communities available online. Use them to supplement your learning.

7. **Stay Updated**: Programming languages evolve. Keep yourself updated with the latest trends and best practices.

Remember, coding is something that should be _repetitive_. Don't rush it; take your time.

**_Note: Do not be scared to ask for help or ask questions. Learning is always about asking questions._**

Alright, see _y'all_ soon. Don't forget to share this :)
